Impression risographique, format A3 sur papier Fabriano 80g.



> Une image apparue au détour d'un geste quotidien. Imprimé dans la ouate, le verso de mon regard. The unseen.
>
> Je la relie à un témoignage de l'artiste Phyllida Barlow vu récemment. 
>
> "There is plenty of artist who dont have exhibitions. There are plenty of art that's never seen. And I think I'm intrigued by that, making work that does not have a destination, has its loneliness and its sadness about it and many artists endure that for their entire life and it's heroic. The novel that never gets published, should it never have been written? Of course it should be. I think there is a lot that's not entirely spoken about or recognized which is the unseen and the unknown of the creative act, as a deeply private experience. There is this great powerful desire to just create something. And does that just get eroded away? I hope not."
